# Predicting Bitcoin Price

## Introduction

For an investor, it will be extremely valuable to know when to buy and when to sell Bitcoin. The goal of this model would be to predict if the price is going up or down based on the Tweet mentioning Bitcoin or BTC. This project will be completed by using Natural Language Processing NLP techniques and classify the tweets of one day into 2 categories (i.e. 'TOMORROW GOING UP' or 'TOMORROW GOING DOWN').


## Dataset

Two datasets will be used, the first dataset will be download from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/alaix14/bitcoin-tweets-20160101-to-20190329) which contains 16 million tweets scrapped from twitters between 1/1/2016 and 29/3/2019 and include the following information: id, user, fullname, url, timestamp, replies, likes, retweets, text.
The second dataset consists of the historical price of Bitcoin. The dataset was obtained by scraping the daily price from the website https://coinmarketcap.com/ between 2/2/2014 to 12/3/2021, this dataset contains the following information: date, price, 24h volume, and 24h price change.
